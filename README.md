## Web Application
***[Explain your app, should be at least a paragraph. What does it do? Why should I use? Sell your product!]***

This website makes request to our other project, a live api server at [this repository](github.com/HCoggers/Lab12-Async-Inn) developed in tandem to present a list of all Hotels, Rooms, and Amenities in the *Async Inn* database. Both projects have been deployed through Azure to deliver an easy to use catalog of all of Async Inn's locations.

When you first come to our site, just click the button and you can see a comprehensive list of all the active locations currently in our database. by selecting "see details" you can find out all about what rooms are available, and what complimentary amenities we provide.

The web application consists of a frontend written in Razor views, HTML, CSS and C#, using Newtonsoft JSON Framework for deserialization. The backend was written in C# using ASP.NET Core 3, Entity Framework Core, and the MVC framework.
